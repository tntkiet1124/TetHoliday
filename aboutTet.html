        <h2>What is the Tet holiday?</h2>
        <p>
          Tet is short for “Tet Nguyen Dan” which literally translates as “The
          Feast of the First Morning of the First Day.” There are three notable
          components to this date: it marks the beginning of the New Lunar Year,
          the start of spring, and the official birthday of everyone in Vietnam.

        <h2>Lucky money</h2>
        <p>
          Traditionally, Lucky Money is a small amount of money put in a red
          envelope then is given to children as a wish of luck and everything
          good will come to them in the lunar new year.

        <h2>Banh Chung (Vietnamese Square Sticky rice cake)</h2>
        <p>
          This cake represents gratitude to the ancestors, the earth, and the
          sky. Also, it emphasizes the important role of rice and nature in
          Vietnamese culture. The harmonious combination of sticky rice, sweet
          green beans, mildly spicy pepper, and fatty pork meat has created a
          remarkable New Year’s taste.

        <h2>Banh Tet</h2>
        <p>
          Banh Tet is quite similar to Banh Chung except for the shape. Although
          they have the same ingredients, Banh Tet is packed into cylindrical
          beams. There are two types of Banh Tet: sweet and savory. With the
          savory type, the filling has traditional beans, fatty pork, salted
          eggs, and sometimes sausage. Sweet Banh Tet is popular with bananas,
          red beans, and green beans as the fillings. They’re great choices if
          you’re vegetarian.

        <h2>Thit Kho Trung (Vietnamese Braised Pork with Eggs)</h2>
        <p>
          On Tet Holiday, in addition to Banh Chung and Banh Tet, people often
          prepare a large pot of braised pork in coconut juice with eggs – Thịt
          Kho trứng. The braised pork is soft but not mushy, and the duck eggs
          are soaked with spices. This dish is not too complicated to make but
          very delicious, suitable for the bustling atmosphere of New Year’s
          Day.
